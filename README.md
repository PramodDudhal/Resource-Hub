# Academic Resource Hub

## Introduction
In the academic world, staying connected and sharing resources with classmates is crucial for success. This "Academic Resource Hub" is a central place where students can easily communicate and access all the materials they need. It ensures everyone knows what resources are available, benefiting not just individuals but the entire academic community. We beleive in the saying:
> Sharing is Caring ðŸ–¤

## Technologies Used
We have used the following technologies:

- <u>**Python-Flask:**</u> We have used python's framework: Flask as our backend. We chose to use it mainly because of the following features:
    1. <u>Lightweight and Flexible:</u> Flask is a micro-framework, meaning it's lightweight and offers flexibility in designing and structuring our backend according to our project's needs.

    2. <u>Easy to Learn:</u> Flask has a simple and intuitive syntax, making it relatively easy for us to learn and use.

    3. <u>Jinja2 Templating:</u> Flask integrates Jinja2 templating engine, which simplifies the process of creating dynamic web pages by allowing us to embed Python code directly into HTML templates.

    4. <u>Integration with Other Technologies:</u> Flask seamlessly integrates with other technologies and frameworks, such as SQLAlchemy for database integration.

- <u>**SQLAlchemy:**</u> We have used flask's integrated feature: SQLAlchemy to store our database. We chose to use it mainly because of the following features:
    1. <u>Flexible Querying:</u> SQLAlchemy provides a flexible query API that allows developers to construct complex database queries using Pythonic syntax.

    2. <u>Schema Definition and Migration:</u> SQLAlchemy allows developers to define database schemas using Python classes and declarative syntax. It supports automatic schema generation based on class definitions and provides tools for database schema migration, making it easier to manage changes to the database schema over time.
